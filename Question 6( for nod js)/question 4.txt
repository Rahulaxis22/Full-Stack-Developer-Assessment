4   Example for Aggregate Lookup property




 Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the $lookup aggregation pipeline stage in MongoDB:

Consider two collections: orders and products.We want to retrieve all orders with their corresponding product 
details by performing a lookup based on the productId field present in the orders collection:




code:

    // Assume you have already connected to the MongoDB database

// Perform the aggregation
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'products',
      localField: 'productId',
      foreignField: '_id',
      as: 'productDetails'
    }
  }
]).toArray(function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error occurred during aggregation:', err);
    return;
  }
  
  console.log('Aggregation result:', result);
});
