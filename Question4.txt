4) console.log("7" > 7)
console.log("2">"21")
console.log("KL">"S")

OutPut: false
        false
        false

Logic And Explanation: 

console.log("7" > 7):
In JavaScript, when comparing values using the > operator, 
if one of the operands is a string and the other is a number, 
JavaScript will attempt to convert the string to a number. 
In this case, "7" is converted to the number 7. 
However, the comparison "7" > 7 results in false because the > operator performs a numerical comparison.
 So, the output is false.

console.log("2" > "21"):
In this comparison, both operands are strings. 
When comparing two strings using the > operator,
JavaScript performs a lexicographic (dictionary-style) comparison based on the character's Unicode values. 
Comparing the first characters, "2" has a lower Unicode value than "2", so the comparison evaluates to false.
Therefore, the output is false.

console.log("KL" > "S"):
Similarly, when comparing strings "KL" and "S", JavaScript compares their Unicode values character by character. 
In this case, the first character of "KL" ("K") has a higher Unicode value than the first character of "S" ("S"). 
Therefore, the comparison evaluates to false, resulting in false as the output.
